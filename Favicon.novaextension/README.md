# Favicon Tags for Nova

This is a clip for generate Favicon tags for many devices for the new IDE - [Nova](https://nova.app/). It's great way for generate more than 20 tags in one click.

You spent time to search documentations for any actual platform to make multi-platform favicon and html meta tags. How much time left for the cross-platform favicon? Probably not much. But no worries, you only need a one click to tackle this task.

## Installation
If you're a proud owner of [Nova](https://panic.com/nova), you ought to be able to go to **Extensions > Extensions Library > Clips (tab)** and pick the clip from there.

If that doesn't work, just clone this project (or download it from the releases page), it'll magically turn into a 'component' thingy, and you can then double-click it to add this theme to Nova!
